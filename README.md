# Image Captioning Final Project

View Notebook : https://colab.research.google.com/github/czynot/Image_Captioning_Final_Project/blob/master/week6_final_project_image_captioning_clean.ipynb

(The notebook does not seem to work on nbviewer because some widget metadata might be violating the JSON schema of Jupyter. View it in Colab instead)

This repository contains the final project for the course Introduction to Deep Learning by National Research University Higher School of Economics.

The notebook contains code to define and train an image-to-caption model, that can produce descriptions for real world images. It implements an architecture of a CNN encoder and a RNN decoder.

The implemented architecture was introduced here https://ai.googleblog.com/2014/11/a-picture-is-worth-thousand-coherent.html in a blog by Google AI.

PS - Do not email me telling me I forgot to remove my authorisation token from the notebook ; it expired already. I'm not dumb, I'm just lazy :)

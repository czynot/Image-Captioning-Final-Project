# Image Captioning Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the course Introduction to Deep Learning by National Research University Higher School of Economics.

Course Link : https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning/

The notebook contains code to define and train an image-to-caption model, that can produce descriptions for real world images. It implements an architecture of a CNN encoder and a RNN decoder.

The implemented architecture was introduced here https://ai.googleblog.com/2014/11/a-picture-is-worth-thousand-coherent.html in a blog by Google AI.

PS - Do not email me telling me I forgot to remove my authorisation token from the notebook ; it expired already. I'm not dumb, I'm just lazy :)
